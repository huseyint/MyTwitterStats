MyTwitterStats
==============

ASP.NET MVC web app that generates stats from twitter user archives.

You can find a working demo instance at http://mytwitterstats.apphb.com/

Note: Since the app stores the stats results on AWS S3, you need to set 
AwsAccessKey and AwsSecretAccessKey settings on web.config.
